# jb-stripper-configs
A complete collection of all my jailbreak map stripper:source configs

For those who are unaware what stripper:source is, it is a plugin that allows the editing of entity data of maps without decompiling.
It does this via config files that tell the plugin what entities to change and how to change them.

You are free to contribute your own configs if you would like.
